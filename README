TSC Covert Voting Process Software
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°

This is the software used to run covert voting processes in TSC. It
includes both a program to generate the cryptographically signed
voting ballots (“genballots.rb”) and a web service software based on
Ruby’s Sinatra library (“covertvote.rb”). The two don’t have to be run
on the same machine.

Dependencies
------------

Both programs are written in Ruby, so you need to have Ruby installed,
at least in version 2.0.0.

The voting ballots generator has no dependencies except the GPG
commandline program, which has thus to be available in your $PATH.

The webservice depends on Ruby’s Sinatra library. Install it using
RubyGems:

    $ gem install sinatra

The software has only been tested and was only written for Linux
systems. Don’t expect it to run anywhere else, though any Unix should
work.

Running
-------

Both programs are marked as executable, so they can be run just by
calling them.

For a recommended procedure in taking votes, read
views/guide.erb. After you started the webservice, you can also read
it on the served website by appending /guide to the main URL.

The webservice prints the listening port on standard output. You can
use the -p option on it to switch it to a different port.
